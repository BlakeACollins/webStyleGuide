# webStyleGuide

This is the fourth project in the Treehouse Techdegree.I was provided completed index.html and styles.css files. I was responsible for converting the CSS into Sass by splitting the code into several Sass partial files. I also look for repeated values (length units, colors, etc.) throughout the CSS and store them in Sass variables
